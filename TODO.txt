Referring Physicians drop down list update with actual doctor names

Submit a Review's form: still to do the resource (and fix in pages

1) Can you line up the bottoms of the Pain Information Center and Review & Testimonial boxes so that it aligns with Sports Medicine's box? You can reduce the spacing of the PIC box and can also reduce the sizes of both the Patient Portal and Reviews & Testimonials boxes to make that happen. When you reduce the sizes of the two boxes on the right, can you see if you can create a little more vertical space between those two boxes?


Patient portal pages
One potential problem I foresee is that people will think these are live elements, and they will be trying to click into the Login fields. Would it be possible to create a rollover state that greys out the image and says something like "Screenshots for reference only, go to Patient Portal to login or sign up"?

SSL Certificate



1.
Use openssl to generate a new private key.

$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.pass.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
......................................................................................+++
......+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for server.pass.key:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for server.pass.key:


[The password is ariberto]


2.
The private key needs to be stripped of its password so it can be loaded without manually entering the password.

$ openssl rsa -in server.pass.key -out server.key
Enter pass phrase for server.pass.key:
writing RSA key


[The password I entered is the same: ariberto]

You now have a server.key private key file in your current working directory.



3.

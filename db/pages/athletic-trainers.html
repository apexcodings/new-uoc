  In addition to having a well-researched and designed sports concussion protocol all “at risk athletics” at our affiliated schools receive a pre-season neuropsychological test (ImPact) to establish baseline function. In the case of concussion, these tests are used to assist in the safe return to play.

<p>
  UOC athletic trainers are dedicated to being prepared to manage athletic injuries both minor and severe in nature. We work closely with local EMS in each community to ensure we are prepared for catastrophic injury. UOC athletic training staff, working in cooperation with school administrators and EMS providers, have developed and published emergency action plans for all practice and game venues to help in the effective management of emergent injury."

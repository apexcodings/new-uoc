<h3>Let UOC manage your team care.</h3>
<p>
  We understand the difficulties of administering your Company’s Worker Compensation claims information and managing the injured employee’s healthcare services and return to work.
</p>

<h3>We know your goal is to:</h3>

<p>
  <b>A.</b> Provide access to cost-effective healthcare services for injured workers 
  <b>B.</b> Efficiently administer compensation claims 
  <b>C.</b> Deliver quality treatment and ensure a timely return to work for injured employees
</p>


<h3>A. UOC Cost-Effectiveness</h3>
<p>
  Cost-effective treatment of work injuries results from accurate diagnosis, timely and effective resource utilization, and clear communication between patients, physicians, payors, and employers. UOC’s case management program is based on early intervention, progressive treatment, and communication of patient status, which eliminates duplication of medical and administrative services therefore reducing costs and improving return to work turnaround time.
</p>

<h3>B. UOC Efficiency</h3>
<p>
  Access to qualified physicians, understanding employer job requirements, and a commitment to service are key elements of an efficient work injury program.
</p>

<p>
  University Orthopedics Center provides full-time physician coverage through offices in State College, Altoona, Lewistown, Huntingdon, and Tyrone, offering immediate access for urgent work injuries. Connie Edsall, RN, UOC’s Care Coordinator, facilitates patient treatment and ensures the timely distribution of information to key stakeholders. She also provides the company assistance with placement of injured workers into modified or light duty while progressing towards the common goal of unrestricted return to work. This care coordination approach delivers accountability and improved service efficiency for employers in the management of work injuries and claims administration.
</p>

<h3>C. UOC Quality Results</h3>
<p>
  Your employee’s health and successful return to work are key measures of quality for any work injury program. At UOC our medical and support staff are committed to exceeding your expectations. We recognize our responsibility for delivering quality outcomes for the patient and the employer and achieving the goal of restoring optimum productivity for both.

<p>Your feet and ankles contain more than 100 bones, tendons, muscles, and
ligaments, which form 33 joints, all designed to work in unison to help
support and balance the weight of your body during daily activities. All it
takes is a mild sprain, strain, or fracture of the foot or ankle to cause pain
and inflammation, slow you down, and potentially cause greater
problems if not treated correctly.</p>

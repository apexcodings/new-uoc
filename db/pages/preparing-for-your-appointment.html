<h3>What to Expect</h3>

<p>
  Prior to your first visit, it is important for us to review your previous medical history. Please arrange to have your medical records from your current health care provider forwarded to our office (fax number: (814) 231-8569) and bring any X-rays or MRI images that may have been taken. Also, please bring a list of your medications prescribed and nonprescribed (over the counter).
</p>

<p>
  To save you time, we will make every attempt to collect your registration information via telephone through our pre-interview process. If you have not been pre-interviewed prior to your appointment, please feel free to contact us at (814) 942-1166 and press “0” to speak with an interviewer.
</p>

<p>
  If you have not had the opportunity to complete our pre-interview process prior to your appointment, please arrive approximately 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment time to speak with one of our interviewers.
</p>

<p>
  Upon checking in for your appointment, we will offer you a copy of our <a href="/pages/privacy-policy">Notice of Privacy Practices</a>. It describes how we may use your health information and outlines your privacy rights under HIPAA, a federal regulation governing patient privacy. We will ask you to sign an acknowledgment that you have been offered this Notice.
</p>

<p>
  Each time you check in for an appointment, we will verify your address, telephone number, and insurance information. Please bring your most current insurance card to each appointment. Be sure to bring any referral forms required by your insurance plan.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of your visit you will stop at one of our check-out desks to pay any co-pays and to schedule your next appointment if needed.

  <li>Please do not ask your healthcare provider to evaluate an additional problem or family member not scheduled for that particular appointment.</li>

<h3>What is “orthopedics/orthopaedics”?</h3>
<p>Orthopedics is the medical specialty concerned with the preservation, restoration, and development of form and function of the musculoskeletal system, extremities, spine, and associated structures by medical, surgical, and physical methods.</p>

<h3>What types of orthopedic services are available at UOC?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Radiology</li>
  <li>Physical Therapy</li>
  <li>Open MRI</li>
  <li>Outpatient Surgery</li>
  <li>Clinical Research</li>
</ul>

<h3>When should I consult an orthopedic physician?</h3>
<p>
  You should contact an orthopedic physician upon referral from a family physician and/or when you require evaluation and/or treatment of an injury or disease involving the musculoskeletal system (bones and/or muscles). You may also request one of our UOC on-call orthopedic physicians as a part of Mount Nittany Medical Center (State College) and Altoona Regional Health System (Altoona) emergency room service that involves treatment of traumatic musculoskeletal injuries.
</p>

<h3>How do I know if I have found the right orthopedic physician?</h3>
<p>
  You have found the right orthopedic physician if he or she has an established “track record” of treating the problem you exhibit and has performed the specific surgical procedure numerous times. You should feel comfortable discussing the details of your specific condition.
</p>


<h3>The term “board certified” is used in reference to the doctors at UOC. What does this term mean?</h3>
<p>
  Being certified by the ABOS (American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery) or the AOBOS (American Osteopathic Board of Orthopaedic Surgery) means that the orthopedic surgeon has met the specified educational, evaluation, and examination requirements of the Board. The board certification process includes the following components:
</p> 

<p>
  <b>Education</b>: Orthopedic surgeons must have graduated from an accredited medical school and have passed all examinations necessary to receive an unrestricted medical license. Additionally, they must have satisfactorily completed five years of graduate orthopedic surgery education in an accredited orthopedic surgery residency program in the United States or Canada. The residency training must include experience with all age groups in operative and non-operative treatment of musculoskeletal injuries, diseases, fractures, deformities, and other injuries in the spine, hand, foot and ankle, and elbow and shoulder. In addition, their training must also have included experience with arthroscopy, rehabilitation, and treating benign and malignant tumors of bone, joints, and muscles.
</p> 

<p>
  <b>Examinations</b>: After completing orthopedic surgery residency education, a doctor must meet the following criteria to become certified by the ABOS or AOBOS:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a full and unrestricted license to practice medicine in the United States, its territories, government service, or Canada.</li>
  <li>Pass the Part I examination, a written examination about the material taught during the residency training.</li>
  <li>Have completed 22 months of practice of operative orthopedic surgery after successfully completing graduate education.</li>
  <li>Have demonstrated professional proficiency and ethical practice based on recommendations from physicians familiar with his/her practice.</li>
  <li>Pass the Part II examination, an oral exam based on operative cases.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the difference between a DO (osteopathic doctor) and MD (medical doctor)?</h3>
<p>
  DO and MD programs have more similarities than they do differences. Both programs require a four-year undergraduate degree in traditional science-based coursework with two years of clinical rotation. Both degrees will prepare a future physician to work as a fully licensed doctor in any medical specialty.
</p> 
<p>
  Furthermore, many of the differences between allopathic and osteopathic medical programs are dissolving in the modern healthcare environment. In the past, osteopathy’s insistence on preventative care and holistic healing distinguished it from allopathic training. The recent emphasis on primary care in MD programs is promoting even greater overlap between the two schools. Even so, there are some important differences between the two degrees.
</p> 
<ul>
  <li>DO programs concentrate more effort on primary care, training strong, general physicians before specialists. They emphasize preventative care and a holistic approach to patient care, treating the whole person, not just symptoms.</li>
  <li>DO programs focus extra attention to musculo-skeletal health and train students in Osteopathic Manipulation Treatment, a unique, hands-on approach to diagnosis and treatment.</li>
  <li>MDs do their clinical rotations in a teaching hospital affiliated with their medical school‚ while DOs do their clinical rotations in community hospitals and local doctors’ offices.</li>
  <li>DOs must pass the COMPLEX board exam to be licensed; in some cases, DOs also take the USMLE board exam if they choose to compete for some allopathic residency program.</li>
  <li>DOs have the option of pursuing an osteopathic residency program or applying for a residency through the National Residency Match Program (“The Match”) used by allopathic physicians.</li>
</ul>

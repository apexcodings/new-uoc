state-of-the-art MRI technology and an experienced staff to ensure
your examination is a positive experience from start to finish. An MRI exam
is the safe and painless way for physicians to view detailed images of your
body without exposing you to X-Ray radiation. The images are then used
to help guide physicians as they diagnose your specific injury or condition.</p>

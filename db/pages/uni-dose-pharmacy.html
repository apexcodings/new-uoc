<p>For patients in our State College, Altoona and Surgical Center locations,
we’ve made filling prescriptions convenient with our in-house pharmacy
service. Simply stop by before you leave and we’ll fill your prescription so
you don’t have to make a stop at the pharmacy on your way home.</p>

<p>
In many cases, if you’re a worker’s compensation patient, we’re able to fill
  your prescription at absolutely no cost.

<p>NextMD is a patient portal service that eliminates time-consuming phone calls and allows you, the patient, on-line access to your physician's office. All requests or questions will be answered within 24 hours. </p>
<p>With respect to system security, unlike emails that use multiple servers over the internet, the NextMD technology allows your doctor to use a single server secured by both a firewall and 128-bit encryption to safeguard your privacy. </p>
<p>This secured system operates by a password protected log-in that you receive upon registering for the service. Only you will have access to your information. Each family member will receive their own log-in code and password. If the patient is under 18 years of age, the responsible parent will receive the enrollment code and password information. </p>

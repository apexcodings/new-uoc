  Prior to entering the MRI Suite, you will be required to remove all jewelry, keys, coins and credit cards. If your clothing has any metallic material such as a zipper, rivets, or belt buckle, you will be provided with an imaging gown for use during the exam. A secure dressing room is provided for all stored items.

  Once dressed, you will then proceed to the scan room where the imaging procedure will be performed. A technologist, who operates the MRI equipment, will scan images in the areas your doctor has requested. The MRI technologist will interact with you to keep you informed and comfortable during the exam procedure in order to get the best results.

  If you have a pacemaker, you should not be imaged. The pacemaker will be affected by scanners in the magnetic field. If you have any metal material within your body such as pins, ferromagnetic clips, etc., you more than likely will not be imaged. These objects could be twisted by the magnetic field which can cause serious injuries. Most new surgical metal implants are made of high quality stainless steel which is non-magnetic.

  The exam typically lasts between 20 to 30 minutes. You will need to lie still for periods of 2 to 4 minutes depending on which test you are being scanned for. During this process you will hear knocking sounds which indicates when the MRI scanning is being turned on and off. You will be supplied with foam ear plugs to protect your ears and or provided headphones with music being provided for your listening pleasure.

  Once the exam is completed, a report will be forwarded to your doctor who will then contact you to discuss the results.

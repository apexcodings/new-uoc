<p>In 2002, we opened our University Orthopedics Surgery Center to help
increase the productivity of our staff, improve procedural efficiency, and
reduce overall operating costs to positively impact the lives of our
patients. Today, our operating suites are equipped with the most
advanced medical technology used by the hands of the some of the
regionâ€™s most accomplished and respected orthopedic surgeons.</p>

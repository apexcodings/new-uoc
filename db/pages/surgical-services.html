<p>In 2002, we opened our University Orthopedics Surgery Center to help
increase the productivity of our physicians and staff, improve procedural
efficiency, and reduce overall operating costs to positively impact the
lives of our patients. Today, our operating suites are equipped with the
most advanced medical technology used by the hands of the some of
the regionâ€™s most accomplished and respected orthopedic surgeons.</p>

<p>For greater convenience for our patients, same-day outpatient surgery is
available at both our <a href="/pages/uocss">UOC Surgery Center</a> and 
our <a href="/pages/adv-center-for-surgery">Advanced Center For Surgery</a>.</p>

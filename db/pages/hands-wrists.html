<p>When you lose the normal function of your hands, fingers, or wrists, you
lose the ability to perform routine, everyday tasks. The frequency with
which we use our hands makes them prone to traumatic injuries, such as
dislocations and fractures. Meanwhile, repetitive motions while at work or
participating in a favorite activity can often lead to common overuse
disorders characterized by chronic pain brought on by tendonitis, arthritis,
or carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>

spend just one or two nights recovering at the hospital of your choice
before returning to your home, where home nursing will continue to
monitor your progress and provide aid over the following two weeks. If
short-term inpatient rehab is needed, your surgeon, hospital care staff and
progress will determine this need at the time of your hospital discharge.
Once you’ve had your follow-up with your physician, we can then
determine your progressive rehabilitation needs.</p>

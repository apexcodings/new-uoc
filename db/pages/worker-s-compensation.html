<p>At University Orthopedics Center, we understand the difficulties of
administrating Worker’s Compensation claims information and effectively
managing healthcare services for injured employees.</p>

<p>To help your company better navigate the challenges of Worker’s
Compensation claims, we’ve developed a Work Injury Program that
focuses on accurate diagnosis and timely resource utilization, and
streamlines communication between patients, physicians, payors and
employers to help reduce costs and speed return-to-work turnaround
times.</p>

<p>For patients, our program is designed to provide access to medical
professionals and support staff committed to successful outcomes and
restoring health for a timely return to work. For those needing care for
more urgent work injuries, our program provides immediate access to fulltime
physicians in our State College, Altoona, Lewistown, Huntingdon, and
Tyrone locations.</p>

<p>To speak with our Care Coordinator Connie Edsall, RN, or to schedule an
appointment, call (800) 505-2101 or 814-231-2101.

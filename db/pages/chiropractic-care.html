<p>When youâ€™re suffering from neck and lower back discomfort or pain, your
quality of life suffers as well. For patients in need of treatment and relief,
the Chiropractic Team at University Orthopedic Center often uses spinal
decompression.</p>

<p>This non-surgical, traction-based treatment is designed to help to alleviate
pain from herniated or bulging discs in the neck or lower back. It can also
be effectively used to help with other spinal conditions, including spinal
stenosis, sciatica, facet syndrome, spondylosis, and radiculopathies of the
arm and leg.</p>

<p>To find out more about the many ways our team can help relieve your
pain and discomfort, or to schedule an appointment, call 814-231-2101.</p>

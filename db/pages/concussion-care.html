 The UOC Comprehensive Concussion Care Clinic staff has the experience and expertise to provide the proper care for this challenging injury. The clinic is directed by internationally renowned expert in concussion care and research, Dr. Ruben Echemendia, and is augmented by UOC’s sports medicine team consisting of sports medicine fellowship trained orthopedic surgeons, psychiatrists, physical therapists, and athletic trainers.</p>

<p>
  Concussion is one of the most common sports injuries. It’s also one of the most difficult to properly evaluate and manage.
</p>

<p>
  Most athletes recover quickly from concussion, but complications can occur if a concussion isn’t properly recognized or treated - especially if the athlete continues playing or returns to play too quickly. Athletes, coaches, and even some health care professionals are not aware of concussion symptoms and treatment options. UOC’s Comprehensive Concussion Care Clinic regularly treats patients who have suffered concussions while playing hockey, soccer, lacrosse, field hockey, football, and other sports.
</p>

<p>
  At UOC, both adolescent and adult patients benefit from:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>State-of-the-art, evidence based care</li>
  <li>Seamless treatment, from injury to return to sport</li>
  <li>Only medically necessary tests and procedures - no gimmicks</li>
  <li>Proper treatment before getting back in the game</li>
  <li>Experience with multiple-concussion patients</li>
</ul>

<p>
  UOC certified athletic trainers have been specially trained by Dr. Ruben Echemendia in the implementation of concussion protocol meeting state, national, and international standards. Our athletic trainers play an active role in baseline testing and return to play procedures. UOC athletic trainers also assist in administering the post injury testing sequence and reporting results to Dr. Echemendia throughout the process. UOC Comprehensive Care Clinic allows for seamless communication between the athlete, parent, coaches, athletic trainer, physical therapists, and doctor - from injury to return sport. UOC athletic trainers then communicate with school personnel so that the injured athlete has specific classroom accommodations during the healing process.

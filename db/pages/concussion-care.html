In order to better manage concussions sustained by area athletes,
University Orthopedics Center utilizes a software tool called ImPACT
(Immediate Post Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing). This
computerized exam has successfully been utilized in many high school,
collegiate and professional sports programs across the country to
diagnose and manage concussions.
</p>

<p>Before beginning contact practice or competition, athletes are
encouraged to undergo a baseline computerized exam. This simple, noninvasive test is set up in a video-game style format and takes about 15-20
minutes to complete. This initial ImPACT test is a preseason physical of the
brain that documents information such as memory, reaction time, speed,
and concentration.</p>

<p>If a concussion is later suspected, the athlete will be required to retake the
test, possibly more than once depending upon the results. The baseline
and post-injury test data will assist our sports medicine specialists in
determining when return-to-play is appropriate and safe for the injured athlete. The ImPACT program provides our sports medicine team with the
best available information for managing concussions and preventing
potential brain damage that can occur from multiple concussions.</p>

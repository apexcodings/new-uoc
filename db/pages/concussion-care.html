In order to better manage concussions sustained by area athletes, our Comprehensive Concussion Care Clinic has been specially designed to focus on the proper care and treatment of this challenging and dangerous injury. Under the leadership of Dr. Ruben Echemendia, an internationally-renowned expert in concussion care and research, the Clinic provides patients with access to a specialized team of sports medicine fellowship trained orthopedic surgeons, psychiatrists, physical therapists, and athletic trainers.

<p>
  To better diagnose and manage concussions, this team utilizes a computerized exam software tool called ImPACT (Immediate Post Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing), which has been successfully used in many high school, collegiate and professional sports programs across the country.
</p>

<p>
  Before beginning contact practice or competition, athletes are encouraged to undergo a baseline computerized exam. This simple, noninvasive test is set up in a video-game style format and takes about 15-20minutes to complete. This initial ImPACT test is a preseason physical of the brain that documents information such as memory, reaction time, speed, and concentration.

<p>
  If a concussion is later suspected, the athlete will be required to retake the test, possibly more than once depending upon the results. The baseline and post-injury test data will assist our sports medicine specialists in determining when return-to-play is appropriate and safe for the injured athlete. The ImPACT program provides our sports medicine team with the best available information for managing concussions and preventing potential brain damage that can occur from multiple concussions.

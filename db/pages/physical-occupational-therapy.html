  University Orthopedics Center (UOC) offers physical therapy in our State College and Altoona office locations. UOC’s physical therapy team is committed to providing efficient, high quality, and compassionate care. Being responsive to patients' individual needs is our top priority. Our physical therapists are licensed healthcare professionals who evaluate and treat people with conditions that limit their ability to move and perform functional activities in their daily lives, whether it is work, athletics, or daily activities. Our goal is to return individuals to their optimal performance and function. We specialize in treating musculoskeletal injuries and post-orthopedic surgical conditions.

<h2>What to expect:</h2>

<p>
  The patient’s first visit to UOC Physical Therapy begins with an evaluation of their entire medical history, muscle strength, and flexibility as well as other important performance factors. Once the evaluation, administered by a licensed physical therapist, is completed, a treatment program will be prescribed that is best suited to the patient’s needs and individual goals. Our physical therapy team, consisting of a physical therapist, physical therapy assistant, and technician, will work together to assist each patient to reach their optimal functional ability. The evaluation and treatment sessions will be with the same therapy team to ensure consistent care. Once the patient is ready to return to regular activities, they receive information and instruction on how to protect themselves against future injury. Make an apppointment today.

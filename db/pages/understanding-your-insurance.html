  You are responsible for managing your insurance. If your insurance company requires a referral, you are responsible to have your primary care physician send a referral to our office in advance of your appointment. If you have any questions regarding your insurance coverage or eligibility, you should call the toll free phone number located on the back of your insurance card.

  It is very important for you to be aware of the requirements and limitations of your health insurance plan so that you will be aware of out-of-pocket expenses and limit frustration later. You will find our staff to be very helpful, but we cannot know everything about the hundreds of insurance plans available to our patients.

  Managed care plans in particular have many rules that you and your physician must follow. For example, you may need a referral or authorization from your primary care physician (PCP) before you see a specialist or have testing done. Failure to do so could leave you responsible for charges. In most cases, your insurance company will not allow your PCP to authorize the visit after the fact.

  When your primary care physician gives you a written order for testing or refers you to a specialist, do not assume that these services have been cleared through your insurance plan. Your physician is simply practicing good medicine and may not be aware of your insurance requirements. It is your responsibility to obtain any referrals that may be required. When you are given a written referral, remember to bring it along to your appointment, otherwise, we may not be authorized to see you. Without a referral, you may have to reschedule your appointment or sign a financial waiver accepting responsibility for any charges.

  As a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, my practice is focused on sports, hand, joint, and reconstructive surgery. It is my goal to help improve the quality of life for all my patients. That is why I strive to stay current with the latest technologies and techniques in the ever changing world of orthopedic treatment. I also take the time to explain the realistic expectations with both conservative and operative care in regard to your orthopedic condition. In this way, I can be sure I am providing you with the best care available.

  In addition to my extensive commitment to medicine, I enjoy spending time with my wife and children.

  As a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, my practice is focused on sports, hand, joint, and reconstructive surgery. It is my goal to help improve the quality of life for all my patients. That is why I strive to stay current with the latest technologies and techniques in the ever changing world of orthopedic treatment. I also take the time to explain the realistic expectations with both conservative and operative care in regard to your orthopedic condition. In this way, I can be sure I am providing you with the best care available.

    "My name is Cheryl and I'm 53 years old. I suffered for 11 years from knee pain. I went the usual route of therapy, cortisone shots, inflammatory drugs, synvisc shots. I hadn't taken a pleasure walk for about three years. I was having trouble performing my job and daily activities. Finally in February 2011, I was done. I had to do something. I went to see Dr. Singer and we scheduled my first knee surgery for June. Surgery went well and I was feeling a lot better in eight weeks. At the end of August, I had my other knee done. I went faithfully to physical therapy until December. Slowly with walking, physical therapy, and determination it all payed off. I joined the gym after therapy was finished, and have continued walking. I walk two to three miles a day. I don't take any medicine anymore after living on ibuprofen and pain medicines for ten years. It’s wonderful. I have my life back. My experience at Blair Orthopedics was very pleasant. The staff was very friendly and fast. Dr. Singer was great, enthusiastic, and happy that he could help me. Even though I'm considered young for this surgery, my quality of life was disappearing fast and Dr. Singer recognized this. I am grateful he did. Would I do it again? You bet." -- Cheryl G.

  "I am a returning patient to Blair Orthopedics. Originally, I chose Blair Orthopedics because I spoke to a doctor friend of mine who said that they would insist on Dr. Singer if they ever found themselves in a situation that called for orthopedic surgery. I initially had my Achilles tendon repaired by Dr. Singer, whom I give the highest recommendation to. He is personable and patient with the mundane questions we have because he understands the fears we have of "not getting back to normal". After my Achilles surgery, it took almost a year but I am back to playing basketball and any other sport I choose without limits. There is little to no residual pain and my range of motion is fine.

  One thing I found during my initial visit is that Blair Orthopedics is thorough and efficient at every level, from check in to check out. Wait time is minimal. The staff is friendly and makes it a point to make eye contact with you when they greet you, even if it is not "your" doctor, nurse, or staff member. Upon my return visit for a tendon repair in my thumb, I am about four weeks post operation and I have little pain. The scars are almost invisible. I receive timely phone calls and emails reminding me about my appointments.  My calls relating to a question were returned promptly and my questions were thoroughly answered. The nurse also made sure that I understood everything and that I did not have any further questions. In closing, I have complete faith in Dr. Singer’s surgical skills and if the way my hand feels now is any indication of how I will recover, it will be like it never even happened. This area is truly blessed to have a surgeon like Dr. Singer and a facility like Blair Orthopedics." -- Benjamin J.

  "Dr. Singer and his PA, Anthony Damin, are the best! During the summer of 2013, Dr. Singer replaced my right knee in June, and my left knee in July. He gave me my life back. I am once again able to move around without pain. Friends commented on my face changing. It no longer mirrored the pain in my knees. A few people from church commented on how my posture had changed because I was standing upright. In February, I was able to dance at my son’s wedding, something I could not have imagined the year before! Over the past few years, Anthony Damin has been a true professional. He is knowledgeable, caring, and personable. He truly cares for his patients. A year after my second surgery, I continue to look forward to my future, which was free of knee pain, and something I could not have imagined prior to my knee replacements." -- M.

  "My story starts with an injury at work. Long story short, I had a piece of farm equipment with a gross weight of 4,950 pounds pin my left hand. The portion of my hand that was crushed was FLAT, but somehow, I call it a miracle, I only had a chipped bone and soft tissue damage. My original doctor was Dr. Rowe, who then referred me to Dr. Singer because he is a hand specialist. I was making an incredible recovery, worked hard at therapy, determined to prove to myself that my accident was not going to cause long-term issues. While at occupational therapy one day, I was getting a tissue massage, and then my hand did something very strange. In the hands of my therapist, my hand turned purple, began to swell, and got noticeably colder. My therapist did not want to scare me, so she wrote it in her report. When I came into Blair Orthopedics for my check up, Dr. Singer confirmed symptoms of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. He referred me to pain management, who confirmed the diagnoses. Being a nervous system disease, Dr. Singer cleared me. A few months go past, and I get referred to Dr. Bozak. Within my 2nd appointment, Dr. Bozak had finally found something for my high sensitivity on my arm, and wrote me a referral for Calmare Therapy. I am very pleased with the treatment I have received from all the doctors, who have worked with me at Blair Orthopedics. I praise them, and recommend them to everyone with back, leg, arm, hand, foot, and/or hip problems. Thank you, Dr. Rowe, Dr. Singer, Dr. Bozak, and all the staff at Blair Orthopedics, for all you have done for me!" -- Josh M.

  "I had trouble with my hand, and then hurt my knee, and it seemed like everything was falling apart. Dr. Singer, and Anthony, put me back together with the greatest care. Now I can give the looser L and run when someone doesn't think it's funny. Just kidding! Thanks, Dr. Singer and Anthony. I am loving life, pain free!" --  Arlene S.

  "I fell down my steps at home, and tore my rotator cuff and bicep muscle. I had x-rays done and therapy done, but it wasn't healing. So I made an appointment to Dr. Singer and his assistant, Anthony. I had surgery done on Dec 3, 2014. I started therapy at Blair Orthopedics and progressed very well. I knew that whenever I had a question or sent an email, I received an answer immediately. This coming December will be one year since my surgery, and I have no pain." -- Karen B.

<h3>Patient Reviews</h3>

  <div class="testimonial"><p>
    "Dr. Saylor treated me for Tendinopathy in my left elbow. After resting it for a month, it did not improve the pain and Dr. Saylor recommended Prolotherapy. Dr. Saylor provided education on the procedure and after doing my own research; I decided to give it a try. I have been an avid weight lifter for 25 years, with many years of power lifting. I was worried that I would have to give up a part of my lifestyle that I love, and possibly need more radical treatment to ease the pain. Much to my surprise, three weeks after receiving one treatment, my elbow feels already feels much better. If fact, it is completely pain free. I have been able to increase the intensity of my workouts, and I am beginning to feel like my old self again. Thank you VERY MUCH, Dr. Saylor. I would highly recommend this procedure to those with similar conditions." -- Troy M.

<div class="testimonial"><p>"I injured my knee at work. After going to the ER, the doctor recommended that I go to Blair Orthopedic for a diagnosis. When I saw Dr. Saylor, he checked me out and had me on the road to recovery right away. I could actually feel my knee recovering little by little. I would highly refer Blair Orthopedics to anyone. Thank you!" -- Don S.</p></div>

  "Without warning one Friday night in November 2012, my femur bone dislocated from the hip socket. After a trip to the ER without results, I visited Blair Orthopedics. I first saw Dr. Saylor, who worked with me to get my injury assessed, and to help get me comfortable. He ordered an MRI for me, which resulted in me getting a cortisone shot in my hip, for some relief from the pain. That relief lasted about a week. That told Dr. Saylor I needed further evaluation and possibly even surgery. That's when I met Dr. Van Kleunen for the first time. I felt totally comfortable with him on our first office visit, just a total calmness about him and his bedside manner. During my visit, he told me I should consider hip surgery for some things that showed up on my MRI. However, he insisted that I not make a quick decision, and discuss it with my family, since recovery time, including therapy, would be 6 months. Surgery was scheduled for January 4, 2013, and that morning, he came in to talk with me after further examining my MRI. He though that he had uncovered additional issues. When it was all said and done, I had a tear, a growth on the ball of my femur bone that was tearing the cartilage in my hip, and some arthritis from an old fall. After surgery, I underwent 3.5 months of therapy. I can tell you that I came back so much stronger than when I started. As a matter of fact, I have kept up with weekday visits to the gym to continue with my "therapy", which has now become a strength training session for me. I've also added upper body exercises as well. So, what first started out as a scary surgery for me, turned into me becoming stronger person." -- Lori P.

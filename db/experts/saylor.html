<p>
  At a young age I developed a respect and passion for the automobile. When I was fifteen, I rebuilt my first car with my father. The automobile, like the human body, utilizes many different parts, forming systems, creating a single functional unit. Academically, I have always excelled in hands-on and analytical tasks such as chemistry, physics and mathematics. This all led me towards an Osteopathic education, which focuses on the body functioning as a unit. The additional training I received as a D.O. in the musculoskeletal system and manipulation led me to sports medicine, allowing me to incorporate all of the skills and passions I have been blessed with since childhood.

  I enjoy working with people to help them accurately assess their problem and make informed decisions about what is best for them. From preschool children on a playground to professional athletes, weekend warriors, laborers, new mothers and grandmas; no matter what activity level, my goal is to provide patients with evidence-based, compassionate care to get them back doing what they love.

  In addition to my medical interests, I enjoy golfing and spending time with my wife and family.

<p>
  As an osteopathic physician specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation, I genuinely enjoy treating my patients through nonsurgical treatment and pain management. It is my goal to make my patients feel better and return them to the activities they love.
</p>

<p>
  While completing my residency, I gained experience covering teams at sporting events, such as the Philadelphia International Cycling Championship and the Air Force Cycling Classic.

  As an athlete myself, I understand how important it is to be able to perform in a sport or activity in peak condition. To keep in good physical health, I enjoy racing for the District of Columbia Velo cycling team.

  "I was involved in a one-car rollover accident. I had a small fracture in my ulna and L4 vertebra. I was initially referred to University Orthopedic Center, but I had decided that I would be continuing my care and treatment with Blair Orthopedics. From my first visit with Blair Orthopedics, I could not have been more satisfied with the level of treatment and care. So it was a not a difficult decision to use Blair Orthopedics for my physical therapy as well. Dr. Lonnie, my physical therapist exemplified the level of care that I experienced with Dr. Bozak." -- Council Nedd

  "My story starts with an injury at work. Long story short, I had a piece of farm equipment with a gross weight of 4,950 pounds pin my left hand. The portion of my hand that was crushed was FLAT, but somehow, I call it a miracle, I only had a chipped bone and soft tissue damage. My original doctor was Dr. Rowe, who then referred me to Dr. Singer because he is a hand specialist. I was making an incredible recovery, worked hard at therapy, determined to prove to myself that my accident was not going to cause long-term issues. While at occupational therapy one day, I was getting a tissue massage, and then my hand did something very strange. In the hands of my therapist, my hand turned purple, began to swell, and got noticeably colder. My therapist did not want to scare me, so she wrote it in her report. When I came into Blair Orthopedics for my check up, Dr. Singer confirmed symptoms of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. He referred me to pain management, who confirmed the diagnoses. Being a nervous system disease, Dr. Singer cleared me. A few months go past, and I get referred to Dr. Bozak. Within my 2nd appointment, Dr. Bozak had finally found something for my high sensitivity on my arm, and wrote me a referral for Calmare Therapy. I am very pleased with the treatment I have received from all the doctors, who have worked with me at Blair Orthopedics. I praise them, and recommend them to everyone with back, leg, arm, hand, foot, and/or hip problems. Thank you, Dr. Rowe, Dr. Singer, Dr. Bozak, and all the staff at Blair Orthopedics, for all you have done for me!" -- Josh M.

  As always, my wait to see Dr. Bozak was short and on schedule. Inasmuch as I detest "needles", I was pleased to learn that Blair Orthopedics is using the latest equipment to assist their doctors in delivering injections to a specific anatomical site. If one has to go for orthopedic treatment, Blair offers the most conducive atmosphere. The reception, check-in and check-out procedures are very efficient. The interface between the staff and patient is one to be admired. Not one sour puss anywhere. The facility is clean and well maintained. Waiting areas are spacious and comfortable. Blair Orthopedics is the Cleveland Clinic of the bones, joints and sore muscle world...the best there is in the area. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Until we see everyone next year, be well and enjoy.

<p>
  As an osteopathic physician specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation, I genuinely enjoy treating my patients through nonsurgical treatment and pain management. It is my goal to make my patients feel better and return them to the activities they love.
</p>

<p>
  While completing my residency, I gained experience covering teams at sporting events, such as the Philadelphia International Cycling Championship and the Air Force Cycling Classic.

<p>
  As an athlete myself, I understand how important it is to be able to perform in a sport or activity in peak condition. To keep in good physical health, I enjoy racing for the District of Columbia Velo cycling team.

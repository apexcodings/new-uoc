    "I injured my elbow in one of my first wrestling meets this season, and thought that I would not wrestle again for the year possibly. With Dr. Kephart's help I was able to wrestle and be successful with my team at Altoona Area High School. Thank you Dr. Kephart and the Blair Orthopedics staff for helping me with my injury." -- Jacob S.

  "I sprained a knee, and my regular doctor decided that I needed to see an orthopedic specialist, possibly to have fluid drained from behind my kneecap. I chose Blair Orthopedics for my referral, simply due to name recognition. I'm glad that I did!
</p>

<p>
  Leading up to my appointment, I had spoken to several friends who had undergone the same procedure, and the overwhelming majority had indicatedthat the process was "very unpleasant.” I'm not a big fan of excruciating pain, and I was very anxious in the days leading up to my office visit. Dr. Kephart used his clinical knowledge and compassionate bedside manner and told me that having the procedure done "then and there" was the ideal scenario, and that the positive results would be noticeable almost immediately.
</p>

<p>
  I don't regret that decision in getting this procedure done. As Dr. Kephart promised, after draining the fluid, my knee was noticeably better. The office staff, nurses, and techs that I encountered were also knowledgeable and personable (props to my receptionist and nurse!).  In short, I highly recommend the Blair Orthopedics team and Dr. Kephart." – Jeff S.

  "I first came to Blair Orthopedics for heel pain. I had been having it for over a year and just dealt with it, till I couldn't take it anymore. We tried a number of things with Dr. Kephart and he never gave up on me. Then when we exhausted what he could do, he sent me to Dr. Budny and there was a procedure called ACP. We gave it a try and for 5 and half months, it was great.
</p>

<p>
  March 2013, the pain was back. I came back to see Dr. Budny. On March 28th, we did the ACP again and thankfully, I am walking 6 miles a day and enjoying every minute of it. I am back to seeing Dr. Kephart for my shoulder. I have a large amount of calcium build up that is causing me problems. He went in and broke up some but I am still having some pain. I have an appointment in November and we may do the same procedure. Hopefully, that will take care of it. I couldn't have asked for more caring doctors and staff. They listen to you and do whatever it takes to get you back to health. I tell anyone who will listen that if they need an orthopedic doctor, Blair Orthopedics is the place to go. Thank you to everyone there for your kindness." -- Tonya

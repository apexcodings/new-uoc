  As a sports enthusiast, I know how much it means for athletes to be able to compete in top-notch condition. I also know even the smallest injury can have enduring effects on an athlete. My love for the game has allowed me to gain hands-on experience in sports medicine by working directly with sports teams, understanding that each athlete is unique and deserves quality treatment options.

  During my fellowship, I enjoyed being the team physician for several local colleges and high schools, including the Reading Phillies baseball team and the Reading Royals ice hockey team.

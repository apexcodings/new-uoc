  Foot and ankle pain can slow down a person’s everyday life, and I enjoy the opportunity to help my patients maintain their healthy, active lifestyles. I am committed to providing each patient with exceptional, evidence-based medical care individualized to his or her specific needs. My practice includes all areas of surgical and nonsurgical foot and ankle care, including surgical treatment for flatfoot deformity, bunions, hammertoes, foot and ankle fractures, and arthritis. I also provide nonsurgical treatment for plantar fasciitis and clubfoot deformity as well as wound care and diabetic care.

  Growing up in a medical family allowed me to see what a great impact one person can have on so many lives. Some of my fondest childhood memories include going to the hospital with my dad. Surgery has always fascinated me, but I love being able to improve a patient's quality of life with nonsurgical options as well. To know that I took part in promoting better overall health is extremely rewarding.

  When I’m not seeing patients at Blair Orthopedics, I enjoy running, cooking, working out, and playing the piano. In addition, I love to spend time with my husband, son, and dogs. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve your experience at Blair Orthopedics.

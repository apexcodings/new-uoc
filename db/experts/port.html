<p>
  As  fellowship-trained and board-certified orthopedic surgeon, my practice is focused on sports medicine and knee and shoulder surgery. My goal as your treating physician is to accurately diagnose the scope of your injury in a timely fashion. Together we can work to define the best solution for you through a combination of time, medication, exercise, limitation of activity, and/or surgery to return you to whatever you have the potential to be. I am committed to providing the most expert, most compassionate, most minimally invasive, most current, and highest-quality care that I can to my patients.

  In addition to my medical interests, I enjoy athletic activities with my wife and children, including running, cycling, and hiking.

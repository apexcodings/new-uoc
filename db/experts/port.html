    "I am pleased to share the experience I have had from a shoulder reversal by Dr. Joshua Port. The pain I had suffered prior to the procedure was very severe. In fact I had to sleep in a recliner for about four months. If someone is in need of such surgery, I would recommend Dr. Port and this surgery. I can lift nearly as much as before the injury, and I have the movement WITHOUT the pain. Thank you to Dr. Port and the staff that worked with me for a full recovery." -- Elwood P.

  "I had injured my left shoulder back in 2003 in a freak accident. I was a very active left-handed bowler and I was facing the possibility of never bowling again until this doctor referred me to Dr. Port. Dr. Port decided to do surgery and what I had was bursitis in my shoulder along with bone spurs. He cleaned my shoulder out and the best part was that the AC joint wasn't injured as bad as the first doctor had thought. Today I still bowl and never had pain in my shoulder since my surgery. Thank you Dr. Port for saving my bowling career." -- Heather P.

  Dr. Port,
</p>

<p>
  Thought you would like to hear about the results of your handi-work. Just over a year ago you replaced the interior part of my knee. You also suggested that bicycling might be a good alternative to running.
</p>

<p>
  I have been using mapmyride to help incorporate bicyling into my workout routine.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, you mentioned that I would benefit by losing a few pounds. Since the surgery I have gone from 221 pounds to 193 pounds, as of last night.
</p> 

<p>
  Thanks for getting me in quickly to get it taken care of and for your wonderful work. -Wesley J.

  "I have been very happy with the treatment that Dr. Port prescribed for my shoulder pain. It is like it never happened, so far. If the pain should ever return, I will be sure to visit with Dr. Port again. I have shared my experience with a number of my friends, and I know of at least one who has visited with Dr. Port and your facility since! Thank you!" -- Roger L.

  "My family doctor referred me to Blair Orthopedics. I had severe pain in my right knee that affected my leg from my ankle to my hip. After they x-rayed it, and told me I had a torn meniscus ligament and some arthritis in the knee, they gave me a steroid shot in the knee. Within 15 minutes, I could feel all the pain leaving. It actually started leaving before I left the office. That has been almost a year ago, and so far, so good. I never had an operation to repair the ligament. I would refer them to anyone. As a matter of fact, now my other knee is bothering me. They may soon get a call. I am a very happy patient." -- Roger W.

  "I am 67 years old and I have a family history of arthritis. I have been very active all my life. I had knee pain with every step, and having pain at night was something I wasn't willing to just accept at my age. I researched local surgeons online, asking friends and relatives who did their surgeries, and how well they did. My aunt had a shoulder replacement surgery performed by Dr. Port and while being in her 80's, did great! I made an appointment with Dr. Port and never looked back. Both knees were bad, so I decided to have them both done at the same time. CRAZY is what most people would say, but I felt I was healthy enough and strong enough to do it.
</p>

<p>
  The surgery went quite well. I had a lot less pain than I expected. I had minimal blood loss. I walked up a few steps and had a 90-degree bend in my knees the day after my surgery. I went home after two days, walking up and down 14 steps several times a day, with minimal pain. I did take pain medication to make therapy easier, and always used ice, ice, ice. I had a minimal amount of swelling. The physical therapist said I was way ahead of most people with one knee replaced on my first day. Oh yes, my incisions are a fine line, minimal scarring. Am I still glad I had both knees done at the same time? ABSOLUTELY YES! Am I glad I went to Blair Orthopedics? ABSOLUTELY YES! My knee replacements did not slow me down either. I am back to my normal active life, but without the pain. Dr. Port and his staff have been great. I hope I don't ever have to, but I definitely would return to Dr. Port and Blair Orthopedics with any future problems." -- Mary E.

  "Dr. Port performed rotator cuff surgery on both shoulders for my husband and me, and a complete shoulder replacement on my 81-year old mother. Dr. Rowe performed an emergency partial hip replacement on my mother on a holiday. Dr. Singer performed hand surgery on my husband. Dr. Saylor performed an initial evaluation and treatment for several problems that we've experienced. We are very confident in and thankful for Blair Orthopedics." -- Jane

  "This was a hard decision for me until I met Dr. Port. His professionalism and honesty speaks for itself. Once he described to me the nature of my problem with the worn out shoulder it was clear to me what I needed to do! His description of the procedure and the recovery were totally correct and I am now reaping the rewards of a healthy shoulder. My recovery was great. Since the surgery in early June of this past year, my life is back to normal with no shoulder pain. I am a forestry consultant and a farmer. The shoulder gets used every day in both professions. I would not hesitate to recommend Blair Orthopedics to anyone. Job well done and a special thanks to all involved for my speedy recovery. I was a good experience given my situation! Thank you all!" -- Thomas O.

  "My story starts with an injury at work. Long story short, I had a piece of farm equipment with a gross weight of 4,950 pounds pin my left hand. The portion of my hand that was crushed was FLAT, but somehow, I call it a miracle, I only had a chipped bone and soft tissue damage. My original doctor was Dr. Rowe, who then referred me to Dr. Singer because he is a hand specialist. I was making an incredible recovery, worked hard at therapy, determined to prove to myself that my accident was not going to cause long-term issues. While at occupational therapy one day, I was getting a tissue massage, and then my hand did something very strange. In the hands of my therapist, my hand turned purple, began to swell, and got noticeably colder. My therapist did not want to scare me, so she wrote it in her report. When I came into Blair Orthopedics for my check up, Dr. Singer confirmed symptoms of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. He referred me to pain management, who confirmed the diagnoses. Being a nervous system disease, Dr. Singer cleared me. A few months go past, and I get referred to Dr. Bozak. Within my 2nd appointment, Dr. Bozak had finally found something for my high sensitivity on my arm, and wrote me a referral for Calmare Therapy. I am very pleased with the treatment I have received from all the doctors, who have worked with me at Blair Orthopedics. I praise them, and recommend them to everyone with back, leg, arm, hand, foot, and/or hip problems. Thank you, Dr. Rowe, Dr. Singer, Dr. Bozak, and all the staff at Blair Orthopedics, for all you have done for me!" -- Josh M.

  "I had suffered for several years with painful arthritis in my knees. When I injured my right knee in 2009, I required treatment and was referred to Dr. Angela Rowe at Blair Orthopedics. With x-rays and her examination, it was determined that I needed a complete knee replacement, which was done in 2010. Dr. Rowe and her staff were wonderful to work with. They were professional, yet personable. My whole experience with Blair Orthopedics, Nason Hospital, and Health South Altoona Rehab was outstanding. I underwent physical therapy in Bedford for several weeks afterward, until I was able function normally. Two years later, when my other knee was so painful, that it kept me awake at night. I went to Dr. Rowe again. Her examination after x-rays revealed I was walking bone on bone, and she spelled out the protocol required to qualify for another complete knee replacement. After a series of shots and pre-op physical therapy, Dr. Rowe replaced my left knee at Nason Hospital. Then I spent time at Health South Altoona once again, with follow-up physical therapy at Mile Level physical therapy in Bedford. Today, I am able at 85 years of age, to live a normal life, and engage in various community activities, without any pain in either knee. Oh, I walk a little funny I guess, but I can walk! Words cannot express the gratitude and appreciation I have for Dr. Rowe and her staff. I can only say that Blair Orthopedics is very fortunate to have her as a part of the team, and thank all of you for your dedication to all those of us needing your services." -- Harry D.

  "I was a patient of Dr. Angela Rowe. I had carpal tunnel syndrome in both my hands, and a trigger finger on my right middle finger during the summer of 2012. The surgery went well, however, I needed physical therapy for the trigger finger. Dr. Rowe sent me to Pro Care in Roaring Spring. Andy was my therapist, and he was excellent. In the spring of 2013, I had a trigger thumb on my left hand, and in the fall of 2013, I had a trigger finger on my ring finger on the right hand. My surgeries have been a complete success. I have recommended Dr. Rowe to several of my coworkers, and they have all been very happy with the outcome of their surgeries. Dr. Rowe and her staff make you feel very at ease. I wish all my doctors had her bedside manner." -- Patty W.

  "I started seeing Dr. Angela Rowe somewhere around 2007, with left knee problems, not being able to bend and feeling of it "giving out.”  Since then, Dr. Rowe has brought me through with therapy, shots, and other help. She told me several years ago that somewhere in my future was a total knee replacement. Finally, this past summer, I was having more trouble and the shots weren't lasting as long, so I made another appointment. That was when she said she felt it was time to do the replacement. I thought it over, and called her office the following day to schedule surgery. Surgery was scheduled for about a month later, and I can now say I am glad I had it done.
</p>  

<p>
  Honestly, I was surprised that the surgery wasn't as bad as I had imagined, after the horror stories I had heard. The recovery and therapy is moving along. It's been just over 3 weeks and therapy is hard work, but it is necessary, and it works. Dr. Rowe is wonderful. She is very patient, understanding, and an awesome surgeon. She and her nurse, Jodi, have put with a lot from me, but have always shown courtesy, care, understanding, and help. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her for anyone having any type of knee problems. She has been wonderful to me." -- Sue G.

  "Dr. Port performed rotator cuff surgery on both shoulders for my husband and me, and a complete shoulder replacement on my 81-year old mother. Dr. Rowe performed an emergency partial hip replacement on my mother on a holiday. Dr. Singer performed hand surgery on my husband. Dr. Saylor performed an initial evaluation and treatment for several problems that we've experienced. We are very confident in and thankful for Blair Orthopedics." -- Jane

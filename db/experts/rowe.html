  I chose orthopedics because it's a relatively new field for women. In fact, I was the first female in my orthopedic residency training program. As a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, I feel I can make a difference by bringing compassion and expertise to my patients. I can treat orthopedic injuries, but I can also relate to how an injury can significantly impact a patient's work and social situation and help them find a solution. But treatment is a collaborative effort. As the treating physician, I will do my very best to assure you the most up-to-date surgical and nonsurgical treatment. Patients do their part by presenting their problems, concerns, and expectations. By working together, we can succeed in making your life better.

  In addition to my extensive commitment to medicine, I enjoy gardening and gourmet cooking as well as fishing.

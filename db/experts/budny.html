  My father is a surgeon, so it was natural for me to choose medicine as a career. Today, I am very interested in medical research and contributing to the advancement of orthopedics, particularly in foot and ankle surgery, my chosen area of specialization. As medicine becomes more specialized every day, I feel a surgeon who is trained extensively in one area can offer better outcomes to their patients. Also, as an avid athlete myself, I believe I can relate to many of the same complaints a patient may bring to my attention. As one of the physicians with Blair Orthopedics, I hope to provide complete and comprehensive care as part of the team approach to your health.

  When I am not busy fulfilling my medical obligations, I am actively involved in fitness and training as well as hiking and camping in the many state parks that central Pennsylvania offers with my wife and two daughters. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to further improve your experience at Blair Orthopedics.

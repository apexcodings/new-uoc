<p>
  "Dr. Budny is awesome! He is a great doctor, has a wonderful personality, very good bedside manner, and talks to you like you are a person. He explains things well and very patient. He did a fantastic job on both my feet and I've recommended him to several friends who are also having problems with their feet. He answered my questions, when I had them, and explained all my options completely. I'd come back with any other problems I have. Actually, he is the fourth doctor I've seen in the office and I recommend all of them! Thanks for the great job and keep it up." -- Louisa O.

  "My son was in an ATV accident June of 2013 and had crush injuries to his ankle. Dr. Budny always told us how he would never sugarcoat anything and I like that. Jeremy also injured his knee, which was first to be fixed by Dr Port. Soon as the swelling went down in the ankle, he had surgery on July 5th. It resulted in 11 screws and 2 plates for the fibula that was broke. We were originally told Jeremy could be down a year. Dr Budny fixed his ankle and Jeremy returned to work last year. He was just released from Dr. Budny in April. Dr. Budny had a lot of crushed bones to work with but he did what he does best and my son was walking, only down 7 months from time of the accident to when he was released to go back to work. I thank Dr. Budny for my son’s ability to walk. He lost some motion as that was to be expected but is doing great thanks to Dr. Budny!! Jeremy listened and did what was asked of him and he healed sooner. My son doesn’t like going to the doctors but he looked forward to seeing Dr Budny. I would not go anywhere else, as Dr. Budny is also my doctor. He treated us with respect and told us every possible outcome so we would be prepared. Thank you for all your hard work, dedication, and for allowing my son to walk again and lead a normal life. God bless all the doctors and staff of Blair Orthopedics." -- Chris W.

  "I first came to Blair Orthopedics for heel pain. I had been having it for over a year and just dealt with it, till I couldn't take it anymore. We tried a number of things with Dr. Kephart and he never gave up on me. Then when we exhausted what he could do, he sent me to Dr. Budny and there was a procedure called ACP. We gave it a try and for 5 and half months, it was great.
</p>

<p>
  March 2013, the pain was back. I came back to see Dr. Budny. On March 28th, we did the ACP again and thankfully, I am walking 6 miles a day and enjoying every minute of it. I am back to seeing Dr. Kephart for my shoulder. I have a large amount of calcium build up that is causing me problems. He went in and broke up some but I am still having some pain. I have an appointment in November and we may do the same procedure. Hopefully, that will take care of it. I couldn't have asked for more caring doctors and staff. They listen to you and do whatever it takes to get you back to health. I tell anyone who will listen that if they need an orthopedic doctor, Blair Orthopedics is the place to go. Thank you to everyone there for your kindness." -- Tonya

  "I want to thank Dr. Adam Budny for getting me out of a cam walker boot I had been wearing for almost 4 years. After two surgeries by another doctor, I went to Blair Orthopedics for a second opinion. Dr. Budny fixed my foot and now I am walking in sneakers again for the first time since 2009. Dr. Budny makes you feel at ease the first time you meet him and he answers all your questions. I would highly recommend Dr. Budny and his outstanding staff. Thank you again." -- Sue L.

  "I was in a head on car crash back on April 25th, 2011. I live in Elk County, and was transported to Altoona. I was treated for fractures on both of my hips, internal injuries, a broken arm, and a crushed foot. I was told that I might loose my right foot because it was crushed when it was stuck on the brake pedal. I was a very active person. I enjoyed hunting, trapping, playing golf, and officiating football. It was very hard for me to accept not being able to do these things again. Dr. Budny came to my room when I was in the hospital, and checked out my foot, but never once mentioned about taking it off. He said he could save it. On July 8th, 2011, Dr. Budny operated on my foot. I was healing in a nursing home in Altoona for several months. I do have some pain in my foot because of arthritis, but I can thank Dr. Budny because I can now play golf, trap, and hunt again. My life will never be the same, but because of Dr. Budny, I have some of my life back. At my last visit, I was told that I will need another operation on my foot, and I have no questions about Dr. Budny doing the surgery. Words cannot express how I feel about the great care I received from Dr. Budny, and the other doctors that have helped me along the way. Thank you, Dr. Budny." -- Craig S.

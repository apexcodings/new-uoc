  Having come from a family of carpenters and engineers, I always enjoyed working with my hands and fixing things. By combining this background with a passion for medicine and a desire to improve the lives of others, orthopedic surgery became a natural career choice for me. As a fellowship-trained sports medicine surgeon, my goal is to diagnose your condition and restore your ability to enjoy life's activities. I am committed to listening to you, discussing your injury, and collaborating with you to find the best treatment to help you heal. I want to be available to you along your road to recovery to help guide you back to your best outcome. I have trained in many cutting-edge techniques in orthopedics and I am dedicated to providing you the most up-to-date non-operative and surgical treatment options.

  In addition to my medical pursuits, I enjoy spending time with my wife and family. In our spare time, we enjoy sports and fitness, music, cooking and entertaining.

<h3>Patient Reviews</h3>

  <div class="testimonial"><p>
    "Dr. Van Kleunen and his nursing staff have been so very kind to me since I began to be his patient in February 2012. My story has been a very difficult one, but his willingness to listen to my problems and guide me in the right direction is something Iâ€™ll always remember. When my son broke his foot, Dr. Van Kleunen fixed him right up, just in time for him to march in the marching band. I have nothing but praise for all of the doctors at Blair Orthopedics and would recommend them to everyone." -- Sarah K.

  "In October 2013, our son was attempting to jump over the couch and in the process broke his ulna and radius. After a week, and another fall while casted, he had to have temporary rods inserted. The day of surgery, he had many questions and concerns. Dr. Van Kleunen took the time to make him feel comfortable. Ryan took his stuffed turtle "Squirt" with him into surgery. In the recovery room, he discovered that Dr. Van Kleunen had casted Squirt on the same side. I know it seems like something insignificant, but to him, it made his day, and made him smile. To us as his parents, it spoke volumes. To have a doctor that can use his expertise, along with showing compassion to a nervous child, we couldn't have asked for a better physician! After an almost five month long period from beginning to discharge, we encountered amazing staff at every appointment. Although it was a long ordeal, we are extremely thankful for every staff person at Blair Orthopedics that treated Ryan with kindness, and made his recovery process as easy as possible!" -- Ryan K.

  "Without warning one Friday night in November 2012, my femur bone dislocated from the hip socket. After a trip to the ER without results, I visited Blair Orthopedics. I first saw Dr. Saylor, who worked with me to get my injury assessed, and to help get me comfortable. He ordered an MRI for me, which resulted in me getting a cortisone shot in my hip, for some relief from the pain. That relief lasted about a week. That told Dr. Saylor I needed further evaluation and possibly even surgery. That's when I met Dr. Van Kleunen for the first time. I felt totally comfortable with him on our first office visit, just a total calmness about him and his bedside manner. During my visit, he told me I should consider hip surgery for some things that showed up on my MRI. However, he insisted that I not make a quick decision, and discuss it with my family, since recovery time, including therapy, would be 6 months. Surgery was scheduled for January 4, 2013, and that morning, he came in to talk with me after further examining my MRI. He though that he had uncovered additional issues. When it was all said and done, I had a tear, a growth on the ball of my femur bone that was tearing the cartilage in my hip, and some arthritis from an old fall. After surgery, I underwent 3.5 months of therapy. I can tell you that I came back so much stronger than when I started. As a matter of fact, I have kept up with weekday visits to the gym to continue with my "therapy", which has now become a strength training session for me. I've also added upper body exercises as well. So, what first started out as a scary surgery for me, turned into me becoming stronger person." -- Lori P.

  "I started seeing doctors about my left shoulder in late 2012. I had physical therapy in Phoenix, and a number of steroid shots. The shoulder did not respond significantly, except temporarily after each shot. Before we moved to Clearville, PA, my orthopedist in Phoenix told me that if it kept bothering me, I should not get anymore shots because something else was going on that needed to be looked at. In the fall of 2013, I saw Dr. Van Kleunen several times. We seriously considered surgery, but I wanted to hold off until after the New Year. I really didn't want it at all. Dr Van Kleunen did not pressure me to have surgery for my slightly torn rotator with calcifications. He wrote a prescription for physical therapy, which I took to Drayer in Bedford. The therapy was very hands-on, and quite painful at first. But there was considerable improvement. I ran out of insured days for therapy. I did maintenance therapy for a while, and then something else orthopedic showed up, and I couldn't handle them both. I discontinued the shoulder therapy, but my shoulder continues to get better and better. I am so glad I didn't have surgery. I think Dr. Van Kleunen is an excellent doctor, who enabled me to heal without surgery. Next week, my husband is going to see him for one of his shoulders, which have bothered him for years. I am confident that Dr. Van Kleunen will provide an assessment and diagnosis, which will be in my husband's best interest." -- Janet L.

  Having come from a family of carpenters and engineers, I always enjoyed working with my hands and fixing things. By combining this background with a passion for medicine and a desire to improve the lives of others, orthopedic surgery became a natural career choice for me. As a fellowship-trained sports medicine surgeon, my goal is to diagnose your condition and restore your ability to enjoy life's activities. I am committed to listening to you, discussing your injury, and collaborating with you to find the best treatment to help you heal. I want to be available to you along your road to recovery to help guide you back to your best outcome. I have trained in many cutting-edge techniques in orthopedics and I am dedicated to providing you the most up-to-date non-operative and surgical treatment options.

  In addition to my medical pursuits, I enjoy spending time with my wife and family. In our spare time, we enjoy sports and fitness, music, cooking and entertaining.
